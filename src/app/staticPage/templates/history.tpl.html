						<h4>Founding Bachman’s</h4>




						<p class="history-body">
							Bachman's has been in business since 1885, when founder Henry Bachman, Sr., planted potatoes, lettuce, onions, and squash on a plot of land in south Minneapolis. Today, that plot contains the firm's headquarters and acres of floral, gift, garden, and landscaping departments, and Bachman's has grown to be one of the largest traditional floral and nursery operations in the world.</p>

							<h4>The Early Years</h4>
							<p class="history-body1">

								From 1885 to 1914, Bachman's raised vegetables, until Albert Bachman, one of Henry's five sons, made the now far-reaching decision to grow flowers rather than vegetables in one of the greenhouses. Throughout the 1920s, flowers were phased in and vegetables were phased out. In the mid-1920s, the first Bachman's retail store was built on the Lyndale site. Albert Bachman also chose the company's distinctive color when a paper salesman presented him with three color choices. Albert chose purple--much to the salesperson's dismay--because no other company wanted to use purple as a company color.</p>

							<h4>1986 to Today</h4>
							<p class="history-body1">

								In 1989, the closing of our European Flower Markets marked the end of an era. The concept of marketing floral products in high-traffic locations, begun by Bachman's in 1968, was now copied by many. It was time for the company to commit dollars and energy to a new marketing concept for the 90's and beyond.</p>
							<p class="history-body1">

								A new marketing strategy was unveiled in 1990 when the first new Bachman's Floral, Home and Garden Center was opened in Maplewood. It was designed as a true destination, adapting the best of the flagship Lyndale store. The Maplewood store was a success and Bachman's has added to it with stores in Apple Valley, Plymouth, Eden Prairie, and Fridley.</p>
							<p class="history-body1">

								Department 56, which today is well-known for its collectibles, including the popular ceramic and porcelain Snowhouses and Snowbabies, began at Bachman's. It was spun off as its own company in 1984 and was sold to a new company formed by Department 56 management and New York-based Forstmann Little & Company in the fall of 1992.</p>

							In 1990, an additional 75 acres were added to the Lakeville farm. Currently, we have a total of 670 acres for raising trees, shrubs, and evergreens, as well as seven acres of greenhouses. Bachman's produces most of its own indoor blooming plants, including over 95,000 poinsettias, 15,000 Easter Lilies, 100,000 mums, and 70,000 azaleas, in addition to many other crops throughout the year. In 1990, we constructed 3,200 square feet of cooler space for use in our bulb and azalea production. In preparation for the continued expansion of our Bachman's Floral, Home and Garden Center retail concept, in 1995 we completed the building of an additional 110,000 square feet of greenhouse production space at our Lakeville site. The new greenhouses include many exciting features, including Integrated Priva computers to provide a consistent thriving environment for plant production, a mobile bench system, an ebb-and-flood watering system, an "Echo Flowering Hanging Basket" system, and much more.</p>

						<p class="history-body2">

							Increased demand for Bachman's quality nursery and landscape products has driven further expansion of Bachman's Nursery Wholesale Center. Landscapers from around the area can now select nursery stock from a 17-acre sales area. We've become known not only for quality, but also selection and availability.</p>

						<p class="history-body2">

							Today Bachman's, Inc. currently has retail locations in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, including six Floral, Home and Garden Centers and floral stores within 27 Lunds & Byerly's stores. Bachman's also operates indoor and outdoor landscaping divisions, a nursery wholesale division, seven acres of greenhouses, and a 670-acre growing range near Lakeville, Minnesota, which produces many of the plants, flowers, and landscaping products sold in Bachman's floral and garden stores</p>

						<p class="history-body2">

							With the dedication of over 1,300 employees, a continued commitment to quality and serving the customer, and an overall love for the business, Bachman's will continue its history of change and innovation in the floral, garden, home decor, and nursery industries.</p>
